## Getting started

The project was developed using the JavaScript-based React framework.

The application separates business logic and UI elements.

Business logic is delegated using the [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org).

Hierarchy of UI components built from ./app folder for UI components and ./store for business logic.

The entire application is typed with [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). Store and actions are also typed.

```
cd frontend
git clone https://gitlab.com/pelecard-front/frontend.git
git checkout development
npm install
npm start
```
